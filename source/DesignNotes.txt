8/25/2014 Token grammar and special characters
Upstream tools like LV place few restrictions on symbol names. VI can have spaces
commas and many other special characters. For this reason generated via files
had dummy names 'videf1' 'videf2'. The VIACodec now supports URL encoding of names so 
the name "Hello World" can be encoded "Hello%20World". In general, special characters
like '+' '-' '%' are not special tokens. Unless they stand alone they are simply part 
of the token they are embedded in, all tokens in the VIA codec are separated 
only by space, tab or parens. As further restriction, tokens that are 
dictionary symbols can only contain {[A-Z] | [a-z] | [0-9] | '_' | '%'} and must
not start with a number, other patterns are reserved for future use. 
As a result of this change, upstream tools can sanitize user symbol names by prepending 
their symbols with a character such as '_' and using %XX URL encoding for non alpha-num
characters.
