### Vireo

A compact parallel execution runtime for VIs saved in VI assembly format (.via files). The *./Documents* folder includes instructions for building and testing on different systems.

This project provides a subset of LabVIEW functionality. An example of its use is in the
EV3 support in the LabVIEW for LEGO® MINDSTORMS® Module. The primary feature set is defined by the VI Assembly files (VIA files) generated by LabVIEW when you target a VI to  the EV3 brick. Feature beyond that core set that can be accessed directly from VIA source should be considered experimental, and subject to change at any time.
