# Vireo

A compact parallel execution runtime for VIs saved in VI assembly format (.via files).

The Vireo project provides a subset of LabVIEW runtime functionality for smaller targets. An example of its use is the EV3 support in the _LabVIEW Module for LEGO® MINDSTORMS®_. The LabVIEW features supported is primarily defined by the features needed for the VIA files generated by LabVIEW.

```

# Testing
From the root directory:

`$ make test` - Runs all tests for Native and JS

## Specific Tests

#### Run All Native Tests
```shell
$ node test.js -all -n
```

#### Run All Javascript Tests
```shell
$ node test.js -all -j
```

#### Run Individual Tests
From within the `test-it` directory:
```shell
